        Working as the only Gainsight admin, I have handled user support for more than 100 CSMs in this role. This combines assisting them with day to day items as well setting up working sessions with them every two weeks to make sure everyone knows about the recent implementations and updates.

        Created product knowledge based onboarding customer email chains and programs based on their closed dates and first license assigned to increase customer ROI.
